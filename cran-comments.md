## Resubmission

Following feedback from Gregor Sayer I have:

* Expanded the Description field.
* Ensured there are no references to 'levitate', 'this package' etc. in
  Title or Description fields.
* Removed examples from unexported functions. This also means there are no
  remaining instances of `\dontrun{}`.

Following feedback from Uwe Ligges I have:

* Single-quoted software names in Description field ('fuzzywuzzy')
* Removed non-GPL compliant LICENSE file
* Added "cph" role to Authors@R


## Test environments

* MacOS 10.15.7 (R-release)
* Ubuntu 20.04  (R-release) 
* Ubuntu 20.04  (R-devel)
