Description: Provides string similarity calculations inspired by the
    Python 'thefuzz' package. Compare strings by edit distance,
    similarity ratio, best matching substring, ordered token matching and
    set-based token matching. A range of edit distance measures are
    available thanks to the 'stringdist' package.
