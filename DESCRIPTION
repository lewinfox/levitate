Description: Provides string similarity calculations inspired by the
    Python 'thefuzz' package. Compare strings by edit distance, similarity
    ratio, best matching substring, ordered token matching and set-based
    token matching. A range of edit distance measures are available thanks
    to the 'stringdist' package.
